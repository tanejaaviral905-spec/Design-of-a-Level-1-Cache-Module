# Design-of-a-Level-1-Cache-Module
Implemented a direct-mapped cache in Verilog with tag store, data store, and valid bits. Designed cache hit/miss detection logic and a finite state machine for load and write operations. Verified functionality using a testbench that tracked hits, misses, and ensured correct memory interaction.
